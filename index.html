            A second-year at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Interests lie in autonomous 
            vehicles, autonomous programming, image recognition, and computer vision. I'm pursuing a
            double major in computer science and software engineering with a quadruple minor in 
            entrepreneurial studies, sustainability, artificial intelligence, and philosophy. Between 
            high school and college, I've had five years of programming experience (mostly Java, but 
            familiar with HTML, CSS, Python, C++, and more; back-end development and object-oriented 
            programming), built and programmed an autonomous racecar, and developed a music recommendation website.</p>
